## Problem Statement
The problem statement for our project is:  
*Our team aims to analyze a real-world sports dataset to identify patterns and relationships that affect player performance and match outcomes. We will apply statistical modeling and predictive techniques, including Linear Regression, ANOVA, and Logistic Regression, to generate actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making in sports.*

## Task Distribution
- **Alok Padal** will lead data analysis and modeling, including data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), applying statistical models, interpreting results, and contributing to report writing.  
- **Dilraj Bista** will handle dataset selection, create visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots, and assist in EDA and documentation.  
- **Karan Tamang** will conduct literature reviews, summarize related works, assist in report documentation, and support application development tasks.  

All team members will collaborate closely to ensure timely completion of all project tasks.

## Planned Analysis
Our planned analysis will follow these steps:  

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, remove duplicates, detect and manage outliers, and convert data into a structured format suitable for analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Use descriptive statistics and visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, box plots) to understand trends, distributions, and relationships between features.  
3. **Statistical Modeling** – Apply Linear Regression to predict numerical outcomes (e.g., player scores), Logistic Regression to predict categorical outcomes (e.g., win/loss), and ANOVA to test for significant differences between groups.  
4. **Visualization and Interpretation** – Present findings through visualizations and interpret results to provide actionable insights on player and team performance.  
5. **Reporting** – Compile all methods, results, insights, and recommendations into a comprehensive report documenting the analysis process.
