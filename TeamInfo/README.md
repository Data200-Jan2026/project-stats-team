## Planned Analysis
Our planned analysis will follow these steps:  

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, remove duplicates, detect and manage outliers, and convert cricket match and player data into a structured format suitable for analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Use descriptive statistics and visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, box plots) to understand trends, distributions, and relationships between players’ performance metrics, match outcomes, and team statistics.  
3. **Statistical Modeling** – Apply Linear Regression to predict numerical outcomes (e.g., runs scored, wickets taken), Logistic Regression to predict categorical outcomes (e.g., win/loss), and ANOVA to test for significant differences between players or matches.  
4. **Visualization and Interpretation** – Present findings through visualizations and interpret results to provide actionable insights on player performance and strategies for Imdol Cricket Club.  
5. **Reporting** – Compile all methods, results, insights, and recommendations into a comprehensive report documenting the analysis process for the club.
