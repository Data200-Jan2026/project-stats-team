# Week 2: Literature Review and Dataset Selection

## Literature Review

1. **Performance Analytics in Cricket**  
   Researchers have applied statistical and predictive modeling to cricket to evaluate player performance and team strategies. Linear Regression and logistic models have been used to predict match outcomes based on historical player stats and match conditions (Kumar & Singh, 2021).  

2. **Predictive Modeling in Sports**  
   Machine learning models, such as Random Forests and Logistic Regression, are commonly used to predict match results in team sports, demonstrating improved accuracy over simple descriptive analysis (Sharma & Gupta, 2020).  

3. **Cricket-Specific Data Analysis**  
   Studies on cricket performance datasets show that detailed metrics like strike rate, batting average, and bowling economy rate can be used to identify high-performing players and inform team selection (Patel et al., 2019).
